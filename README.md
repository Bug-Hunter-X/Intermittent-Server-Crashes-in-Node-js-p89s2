# Intermittent Server Crashes in Node.js

This repository demonstrates a scenario where a Node.js server crashes intermittently without providing clear error messages in the logs.  The issue is particularly difficult to debug due to its unpredictable nature.  The solution focuses on robust error handling and monitoring to identify the root cause.

## Bug Description

A seemingly simple Node.js HTTP server occasionally crashes without any apparent reason.  The logs do not provide useful information to pinpoint the problem. This makes debugging and resolving the issue challenging.

## Solution

The solution involves implementing comprehensive error handling to catch unexpected exceptions and employing a process monitoring mechanism to restart the server gracefully if it crashes.
